- choose the least amount of stocks possible, in this case 12, so that our portfolio is as un-diversified as possible.
- because we can choose the weighting of each stock, we will also choose to put the most amount of weight in the riskiest stocks
- calculate the std of each stock, then consider correlation between them (closest to 1 as possible) 
- make our own version of pearsons correlation formula to find the correlation 

- More precisely, we will calculate the correlation between each combination of 12 stocks
kind each combination

SN, N > 25
Find each combination of 12 stocks out of N of them, where N is the given amount in the Ticker file
For each combination of 12 stocks, calculate the multivariable correlation between each of them and the standard deviation of a portfolio with 
those 12 stocks from January to October 2022
Assign the standard deviation and correlation (where correlation is between -1 and 1) a weight such that their sum is 100%
Find the sum of the weighted standard deviation and correlation

Motivation.
Standard deviation is a measure of risk because it is a calculation of the average absolute distance of a stock's price from its expected value
over some time interval (in this case, January to October), so we want to maximize lt because generally, price patterns are repeated



Main Algorithm: Returns the optimal combination of 12 stocks and their proportions

Assume we start with N stocks, where N > 25.
1) Base Case (N=12), Return a call of Algorithm 2, passing in a list of a list of 12 stocks and the standard deviation of their price weighted index
2) Apply Algorithm 1, passing in a list of N-2 stocks and the two stocks with the highest correlation in the form of a price weighted index
3) Store the list of 12 stocks returned by Algorithm 1 in a list, as well as the standard deviation of the price weighted index formed by those 12 stocks
2) Apply Main Algorithm recursively, one step closer to the base case, with the stock of lowest standard deviation removed from the list of N stocks

Algorithm 1:
Assume we start with M stocks, where M = and a price weighted index.
1) Base Case: 
1) Calculate the correlation between each of the M stocks and the price weighted index
2) Add the stock with the highest correlation
3) Recurse on the N stocks minus the stocks added to the index, each time choosing the stock with the highest correlation to the index 

Algorithm 2:
