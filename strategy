- choose the least amount of stocks possible, in this case 12, so that our portfolio is as un-diversified as possible.
- because we can choose the weighting of each stock, we will also choose to put the most amount of weight in the riskiest stocks
- calculate the std of each stock, then consider correlation between them (closest to 1 as possible) 
- make our own version of pearsons correlation formula to find the correlation 

- More precisely, we will calculate the correlation between each combination of 12 stocks
kind each combination

Find each combination of 12 stocks out of N of them, where N is the given amount in the Ticker file
For each combination of 12 stocks, calculate the multivariable correlation between each of them and the standard deviation of a portfolio with 
those 12 stocks from January to October 2022
Assign the standard deviation and correlation (where correlation is between -1 and 1) a weight such that their sum is 100%
Find the sum of the weighted standard deviation and correlation

Motivation.
Standard deviation is a measure of risk because it is a calculation of the average absolute distance of a stock's price from its expected value
over some time interval (in this case, January to October), so we want to maximize lt because genearlly, price patterns are repeated
